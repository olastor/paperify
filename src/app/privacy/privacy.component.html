</p><h3 id="dsg-general-legalbasis">Substantial legal bases </h3><p>In accordance with Art. 13 DSGVO we inform you of the legal bases of our data processing. If the legal basis is not mentioned in the data protection declaration, the following applies: The legal basis for obtaining consents is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a and Art. 7 DSGVO, the legal basis for processing for the performance of our services and performance of contractual measures as well as for answering inquiries is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b DSGVO, the legal basis for processing to fulfil our legal obligations is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c DSGVO, and the legal basis for processing to protect our legitimate interests is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO. In the event that the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person require the processing of personal data, Article 6(1)(d) DSGVO serves as the legal basis.</p><h3 id="dsg-general-securitymeasures">Security measures</h3><p>We take appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk, taking into account the state of the art, the implementation costs and the type, scope, circumstances and purposes of processing as well as the different probability of occurrence and severity of the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in accordance with Art. 32 DSGVO.<br>
<br>
Such measures shall in particular include ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data by controlling physical access to the data, as well as the access, input, transmission, security of availability and its separation. Furthermore, we have established procedures to ensure the exercise of rights of data subjects, deletion of data and reaction to endangerment of data. Furthermore, we already consider the protection of personal data during the development or selection of hardware, software and procedures, in accordance with the principle of data protection through technology design and data protection-friendly presettings (Art. 25 DSGVO).<br>
</p><h3 id="dsg-general-coprocessing">cooperation with contract processors and third parties</h3><p> If we disclose data to other persons and companies (contract processors or third parties) within the scope of our processing, if we transfer them to them or otherwise grant them access to the data, this is only on the basis of a legal permission (e.g.B. if a transmission of the data to third parties, such as payment service providers, is required for contract fulfilment pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 letter b DSGVO), you have consented, a legal obligation provides for this or on the basis of our legitimate interests (e.g. when using agents, web hosts, etc.). <br>

Subject to legal or contractual permissions, we process or leave the data in a third country only if the special requirements of Art. 44 ff. Process DSGVO. This means, for example, processing is carried out on the basis of special guarantees, such as the officially recognised determination of a data protection level corresponding to the EU (e.g. for the USA by the "Privacy Shield") or compliance with officially recognised special contractual obligations (so-called "standard contractual clauses").</p><h3 id="dsg-general-rightssubject">rights of the data subjects</h3><p>You have the right to request confirmation as to whether the data concerned are processed and to request information about this data as well as further information and a copy of the data in accordance with Art. 15 DSGVO.<br>
