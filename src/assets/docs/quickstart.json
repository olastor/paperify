It is \na powerful tool which can convert plain text into beautiful PDF files. The\nfollowing gives a brief overview over the things that are possible. This \nquickstart is still in an early version, so don't expect much ;).\n\n# Syntax\n\n## Markdown\n\nMarkdown is a lightweight markup language. In order to not get very confused, \n**only look at the PDF** for the next paragraph:\n\n```Markdown\n# Syntax\n\n## Markdown\n\nMarkdown is a lightweight markup language.\n```\n\nThe above is how the beginning of this document originally looks like before \nit's converted to PDF. You can verify this by looking at the editor on the\nleft side. Then you'll see the whole code of this document.\n\n### References\n\n- **Cheatsheet:** [https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf)\n\n## LaTeX\n\n\nThe syntax of LaTeX (or TeX), a document preparation system, is more complex \nthan Markdown, but also more advanced. There are many things you can do with \nit, that we'll just take a look at a few common and simple examples of how it's\nused:\n\n### Equations\n\nA simple equation with code:\n\n$$\nE = mc^2\n$$\n\n```Latex\n$$\nE = mc^2\n$$\n```\n\nA more complex (numbered) equation:\n\n\begin{equation}\nU(\nu, T) = \frac{8\pi h \nu^3}{c^3} \frac{1}{e^{h \nu/kT} - 1} \n\end{equation}\n\ncan be written with this code:\n\n```Latex\n\begin{equation}\nU(\nu, T) = \frac{8\pi h \nu^3}{c^3} \frac{1}{e^{h \nu/kT} - 1} \n\end{equation}\n```\n\n### Formatting\n\n- `\newpage` will add a new page at the current position\n- `\tableofcontents` will print the table of contents (also see the `--toc` parameter)\n- ...\n\n### Special Characters\n\n- Greek Alphabet: $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, ...  A, B, $\Gamma$ ...\n- ...\n\n### Further Tutorials\n\n- **Cheetsheet:** [https://users.dickinson.edu/~richesod/latex/latexcheatsheet.pdf](https://users.dickinson.edu/~richesod/latex/latexcheatsheet.pdf)\n- **Detailed Documentations:** [http://www.rpi.edu/dept/arc/docs/latex/latex-intro.pdf](http://www.rpi.edu/dept/arc/docs/latex/latex-intro.pdf)\n\n## YAML Header\n\nThe thing at the top of the document contains header information like\n\n```Yaml\n---\ntitle: Quickstart\nauthor: Don Joe\n---\n```\n\nA detailed list of options that can be added can be found at the \n[Pandoc MANUAL](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#variables-for-latex).\n\n# Parameters\n\nParameters are additional settings that one would add in the terminal when\nusing pandoc in the terminal. The documentation for all params can be found\nagain at the [Pandoc MANUAL](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#general-writer-options).\nHowever, not all params are allowed to be used on this site. To get an updated\nlist of params which are, navigate your browser [here](https://www.paperify.org/api/list/params).\nYou can play around with them in the text input above the editor."
